how it works: the library works by using a bunch of int veriables for each pin

command list

first u need to use: d1pinumbers wanted name;

after in any function use: wanted name.setnumbers(); to set the Wemos D1 R32 pin numbers to be the same as arduino.

from this point insted of using the normal pin numbers use: pinarduino pin number
